        <ul>
          <li>
            Need more lighting in the parking lot for the safety of our members
            especially the dark corners.
          </li>
          <li>
            AC needs to cool the West offices of the building. It is very warm
            during the summer even when the unit is turned down.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cameras by the trash so we can report the neighbors dumping public
            trash even when the trash is locked.
          </li>
          <li>
            The AC unit in the nursery room have been broken and need
            replacement. It leaks and does not stay cold and would overheat in
            the summer months and freezes up then we have to turn it off for the
            nursery babies in there. An FIR request was submitted a while ago
            but no response.

        <h3>3A. Cut door for access to kitchen (West)</h3>
        <p>
          Cut concrete wall for door to access the kitchen.Â May need to rework
          the kitchen drainage and pipes to either the right or left side of the
          new proposed kitchen door. Hope to keep the 2 ovens and the sink in
          the kitchen as is. This would be the OPTION we prefer to go with, if
          cannot 3B is our other proposal.

        <h3>3B. Cut door for access to kitchen (West)</h3>
        <p>
          Cut concrete wall for door to access the kitchen. Remove or relocate
          AC unit. Currently both entrance and exit doors (West) are the only
          kitchen access which is on the North and Side ends of the building.

          Non-matching cushioned chairs. These are the older cushioned chairs.
          Is there a record when these chairs were purchased? Would they need to
          be replaced?
